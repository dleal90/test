# BondCaller

This is a student project designed to create a Reinforced Learning agent to predict the optimal times to call corporate bonds, if at all.

## Setup

To set up this project, Python needs to be installed and added to environment variables. Additionally, pip needs to be installed which can be done by right-clicking and "Save link as" the file: [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py), then running `python C:\...\get-pip.py` in a command shell

Once pip is installed you can install [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), a necessary plotting library for this project, by running the following in a command shell.

```
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools
python -m pip install matplotlib
```
